# TATAMOTORS-STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION USING LSTM

## ABSTRACT

 -> The abstract of the project "Tata Motors Stock Price Prediction using LSTM" focuses on predicting the stock price of Tata Motors Limited, a leading Indian multinational automotive manufacturing company, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. 

-> The LSTM algorithm is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well-suited for handling time series data. 

-> The results of the project show that the LSTM model can accurately predict the stock price of Tata Motors, making it a useful tool for investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions.
