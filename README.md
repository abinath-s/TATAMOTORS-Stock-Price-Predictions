# TATAMOTORS-STOCK-PRICE-PREDICTION USING LSTM

## ABSTRACT

 -> The abstract of the project "Tata Motors Stock Price Prediction using LSTM" focuses on predicting the stock price of Tata Motors Limited, a leading Indian multinational automotive manufacturing company, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. 

-> The LSTM algorithm is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well-suited for handling time series data. 

-> The results of the project show that the LSTM model can accurately predict the stock price of Tata Motors, making it a useful tool for investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions.


## INTRODUCTION

-> The term stock market refers to several exchanges in which shares of publicly held companies are bought and sold and runs by the principles of demand and supply.

-> Time Series Forecasting is widely used for predicting the future. uses information regarding historical values and associated patterns to predict future activity

-> Tata Motors Limited, a leading Indian multinational automotive manufacturing company. Tata Motors is one of the largest automobile companies in India and has a significant impact on the Indian economy and stock market.

-> LSTM - in this project I am using LSTM model. it has ability to remember previous inputs for a long period of time.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 

This project mainly aims to improve the predictive accuracy of TataMotors stock prices and determine if Time series forecasting and LSTM models can be used to offer insights regarding the future stock prices On a broad perspective, we target to build models to predict the rise and fall of the stock price pattern and forecast the day-to-day stock price of TataMotors that would help the company for a better planning.

## NEED FOR STUDY 

-> Accurate prediction of stock prices can help investors make informed decisions and potentially maximize their returns.

-> To give some useful insights to the industry for decision making and to see the trend pattern and the stock movement
